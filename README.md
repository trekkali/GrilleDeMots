# Word grid

This project consists of a simulation of hidden word games made in C language and Python.
The objective is to find hidden words in a given grid of letters. The player is asked to enter the words he thinks he will find in the grid, and the program checks if the words are present in the list of hidden words.

# Through this experience, I learned several programming concepts and techniques:

Manipulating multidimensional arrays: I used two-dimensional arrays to represent the letter grid in both versions of the program.
This allowed me to understand how to access individual grid elements.

Use of functions: I implemented functions in both versions of the program to check if a given word is present in the list of hidden words.
This allowed me to modularize my code and make it easier to read and maintain.

User Interaction: I learned how to interact with the user by displaying messages on the screen and getting user inputs using the scanf function in C and the input function in Python. 
I also provided feedback on the hidden words found.

Using standard libraries: In Python, I used features provided by the standard library, including the join function to concatenate elements of a list and the upper function to convert user input to uppercase. 
In C, I used the standard libraries <stdio.h> and <stdbool.h> to handle I/O and boolean values ​​respectively.

Management of character strings: I manipulated the character strings to compare the hidden words entered by the user with those stored in the list of hidden words. This allowed me to understand how to work with strings in C and Python.

In summary, this project gave me hands-on experience to strengthen my programming skills in C and Python, as well as learn how to use collaborative development tools like Git and GitHub. I gained a better understanding of how programs can be structured and developed in a modular way, which will be very useful in my future projects.
